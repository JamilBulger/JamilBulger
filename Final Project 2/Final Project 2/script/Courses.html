                <h3>Needs Assess & Tech Transfer</h3>
                <img src="../images/needs-assess.jpg" class="round" alt="needs" class="round">
                <p>Complex problems in modern organizations require an information technologist to systematically analyze problem areas to determine the most effective and cost-efficient solutions. This course builds student skills in two different yet</p> 
				<p>interacting areas: needs assessment (requirements analysis) and group problem solving.Students use interviewing and problem-solving techniques to uncover the constraints that surround problem areas. Students learn the questions to ask</p>
				<p>during needs assessment and develop the interpersonal skills to conduct these meetings. Emphasis is on the steps in creative problem solving, the basics of meeting planning to maximize group effectiveness and helping a client to focus concerns into a
                   clearly defined problem.</p>
